## The Challege
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My Process
1. Look at data and define types
2. Scaffold CSS file for responsive design 
2. Decided on components
2. Define state and where it lives
4. What changes when state changes
